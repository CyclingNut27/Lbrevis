#The followng project describes the life history parameters and the interacting abiotic variables of the brief squid, Lolliguncula brevis.
#The goal of the project is to find significance in the datas relationships and ultimately attempt a multivariable analysis to see the complexity of the variables relationship on each other.  
#The project uses the following experimental design:
  #Squid were collected from four stations along a salinity gradient every month. There were no constraints on squid size or abundance,       only what was collected during a 15 minute trawl at each site.
  #Stations included (from Marine to Fresh water) Anchorage, Fort Johnson, Lower Ashley, Upper Ashley
  #Squid were measured for sex, mantle length, gladius length (the pen of the squid), and length overall
  #abiotic factors of temperature and salinity were collected at each sampling event.
  
#The code follows a structure of creating multiple sub-data frames, visualizing relationships, and then significant variable interaction analyses

#Results and plots should be able to be recreated fairly easily, but feel free to contact me if you encounter issues or question.  Thank you for your review and I look forward to hearing your feedback!
